# Anki Flashcards for Music Theory

Python scripts based on [Gonzalo Ciruelos' musthe](https://github.com/gciruelos/musthe) to learn :
1. Music key signatures
2. Music major modes and associated chords
3. All the intervals with all the notes
4. Most common scales & modes

I made a few changes to musthe Python code, a cleaner fix / fork will come

You can find generated CSV decks in "decks" folder.
Otherwise, you can just change the code as you please and run ```python my-script.py > my-deck.csv```

I shared a few decks [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/785148670) and [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1408221842)
